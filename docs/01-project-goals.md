# 1. Introduction

A manipulator is a robot that performs various manipulation tasks. Common tasks include pick and place, nonprehensile manipulation, tooling, assembling, and many others. This project aims to be a complete high-level meta-package that can be used for any serial manipulator with minimal adaptation effort. It is designed for education, research, and practical applications.

# 2. Project Philosophy and Objectives

Selecting an appropriate approach depends on the user's needs, constraints, and performance tolerance. This package serves as a foundational layer to help users perform the most common tasks, while allowing adaptation to specific hardware and the creation of new tasks. Both model-based and learning-based approaches should be evaluated using quantitative benchmarks.

**Detailed Objectives:**
- Provide a modular and extensible framework for serial manipulators.
- Support both model-based and learning-based control strategies.
- Enable rapid prototyping and deployment for a wide range of manipulation tasks.
- Ensure compatibility with various hardware platforms and sensors.
- Offer clear interfaces for integrating new algorithms and controllers.
- Supply comprehensive documentation and examples for education and research.
- Facilitate benchmarking and comparison of different approaches using standardized metrics.

# 3. Usage Scenarios

- Educational settings for teaching robotics and control.
- Research projects exploring new algorithms or hardware.
- Industrial or practical applications requiring flexible manipulation solutions.
- Rapid prototyping and testing of new manipulation tasks or controllers.
